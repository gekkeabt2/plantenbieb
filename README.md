# PlantenBieb

This is PlantenBieb, it is a Marketplace kind of website where people can share their cuttings, seeds and plants. The idea is that people give away cuttings, seeds and plants they have more of than they need. This way other people can also grow those plants and at a later moment share their plants with others as well.

At this moment the site is functional and a demo can be viewed at: http://ahmedsy301.301.axc.nl/

There are no bugs as far as I know, however there are some missing functionalities that I am willing to implement. This includes: reviewing users, including a score system where frequent sharers get points.

One thing I am not really confident about is the security of the platform, so if anyone is willing to look into the database queries and tell me if it's secure or not I would be really happy. Other security/performance issues can be sent to me as well (in the issues section).

The language is dutch.

Some components I used:
Medoo and PHPMailer
